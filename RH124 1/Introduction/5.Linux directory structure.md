In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), the Linux directory structure is organized in a way that helps with system management, data storage, and software organization. Each directory has a specific purpose, and here’s a quick rundown of the key directories that start from the root (`/`):

### 1. **`/` (Root Directory)**

- **Purpose**: This is the top-level directory in the filesystem hierarchy. Everything on the system is located under this directory. It contains all other directories and system files.
    

### 2. **`/bin` (Binaries)**

- **Purpose**: This directory contains essential command binaries (programs) that are needed for system booting, repairing, or in single-user mode. Common tools like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, and `cat` are found here.
    
- **Example**: `/bin/ls`
    

### 3. **`/boot` (Boot Files)**

- **Purpose**: Contains files needed to boot the system, including the Linux kernel (`vmlinuz`), initial RAM disk image (`initrd`), and the bootloader configuration files like GRUB (`grub/`).
    
- **Example**: `/boot/vmlinuz`, `/boot/grub2`
    

### 4. **`/dev` (Device Files)**

- **Purpose**: Contains device files that represent physical or virtual devices on the system. For example, hard drives, USB devices, and terminal devices are represented here.
    
- **Example**: `/dev/sda` (first hard disk), `/dev/tty1` (terminal 1)
    

### 5. **`/etc` (Configuration Files)**

- **Purpose**: Contains all system-wide configuration files and subdirectories. This includes settings for system services, user configurations, network settings, etc.
    
- **Example**: `/etc/passwd` (user account info), `/etc/network/` (network configurations)
    

### 6. **`/home` (User Home Directories)**

- **Purpose**: Holds user-specific data and configuration files. Each user on the system has a subdirectory here (e.g., `/home/username`).
    
- **Example**: `/home/john`
    

### 7. **`/lib` (Libraries)**

- **Purpose**: Contains shared libraries required by programs in `/bin` and `/sbin` to execute. These libraries are essential for the system to function properly.
    
- **Example**: `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6`
    

### 8. **`/media` (Removable Media)**

- **Purpose**: A mount point for removable devices like USB drives, CDs, and DVDs. It’s where these devices are mounted when connected to the system.
    
- **Example**: `/media/usb`
    

### 9. **`/mnt` (Mount Points)**

- **Purpose**: A generic location where temporary filesystems or external storage can be mounted. It’s commonly used for mounting filesystems manually.
    
- **Example**: `/mnt/data`
    

### 10. **`/opt` (Optional Software Packages)**

- **Purpose**: Holds optional software packages that are not part of the default system installation. These packages typically include software installed from third-party vendors.
    
- **Example**: `/opt/lampp/` (XAMPP installation)
    

### 11. **`/proc` (Process Information)**

- **Purpose**: A virtual filesystem that provides information about running processes and the kernel. It does not contain actual files but instead provides an interface to kernel data structures.
    
- **Example**: `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/1/status`
    

### 12. **`/root` (Root User’s Home)**

- **Purpose**: The home directory for the root (administrator) user. It’s different from `/home` since it’s reserved for the system’s superuser.
    
- **Example**: `/root/`
    

### 13. **`/run` (Runtime Data)**

- **Purpose**: Stores runtime information about the system, including information about running services and processes. It is often mounted as a temporary filesystem.
    
- **Example**: `/run/user/1000/`
    

### 14. **`/sbin` (System Binaries)**

- **Purpose**: Contains essential system binaries, typically for system administration tasks. These binaries are necessary for booting and repairing the system.
    
- **Example**: `/sbin/fsck`, `/sbin/shutdown`
    

### 15. **`/srv` (Service Data)**

- **Purpose**: Contains data for services provided by the system. For example, data for web servers or FTP servers might be found here.
    
- **Example**: `/srv/www/`
    

### 16. **`/sys` (System Information)**

- **Purpose**: A virtual filesystem that provides information and configuration about the kernel, devices, and other system components.
    
- **Example**: `/sys/class/net/eth0` (network interface details)
    

### 17. **`/tmp` (Temporary Files)**

- **Purpose**: Used for storing temporary files that are needed for a short period of time. These files are often deleted during system shutdown or after a certain period.
    
- **Example**: `/tmp/session-file`
    

### 18. **`/usr` (User Programs)**

- **Purpose**: Contains user-level programs and data. This is one of the largest directories and holds applications, libraries, documentation, and other non-essential files.
    
- **Subdirectories**:
    
    - `/usr/bin` – Non-essential command binaries
        
    - `/usr/lib` – Libraries for system programs
        
    - `/usr/share` – Architecture-independent data like docs and icons
        
- **Example**: `/usr/bin/python`
    

### 19. **`/var` (Variable Files)**

- **Purpose**: Contains files that are expected to grow in size, such as logs, mail spools, and databases.
    
- **Example**: `/var/log/` (log files), `/var/spool/` (mail spool)
